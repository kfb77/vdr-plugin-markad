.SH "NAME"
MarkAd \- marks advertisements in VDR recordings.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B markad
[options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B MarkAd
marks advertisements in VDR recordings.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
Usage: markad [options] cmd <recording>
.TP 
.BI \-b\ ,\ \-\-background
 \fImarkad\fR runs as a background\-process
 this will be automatically set if called with "after"
.TP 
.BI \-l\ ,\ \-\-logocachedir
 directory where predefined logos were stored, default \fI/var/lib/markad\fR
 notice: channels sometimes change their logo, you have to to keep the cache up to date
 wrong logos will result in bad mark results
.TP 
.BI \-\-autologo= <option>
 if there is no suitable logo file found, markad will try to find the logo from the recording and store the result in the recording directory
 <option>   0 = disable, only use logos from logo cache directory
            1 = deprecated, do not use
            2 = enable, if there is no suitable logo in the logo cache directory (default)
                find logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
                use it only on systems with >= 1 GB main memory
.TP 
.BI \-\-fulldecode
 this option is only available on command line usage
 decode all video frame types
 use it only on powerful CPUs, it will double overall run time
.TP
.BI \-\-fullencode=<streams>
 this option is only available for command line usage
 full re-encode video generated by --cut
 use it only on powerful CPUs, it will double overall run time
 <streams>  all  = keep all video and audio streams of the recording
            best = only encode best video and best audio stream, drop rest
.TP
.BI \-p\ ,\ \-\-priority= <priority>
 software priority of markad when running in background
 <priority> from \-20...19, default 19
.TP 
.BI \-r\ ,\ \-\-ioprio= <class>[,<level>]
 io priority of markad when running in background
 <class> 1 = realtime, <level> from 0..7, default 4
             2 = besteffort, <level> from 0..7, default 4
             3 = idle (default)
 make sure your I/O scheduler supports scheduling priorities and classes (e.g. BFQ or CFQ)
.TP 
.BI \-v\ ,\ \-\-verbose
 increments loglevel by one, can be given multiple times
.TP 
.BI \-B\ ,\ \-\-backupmarks
 make a backup of existing marks
.TP 
.BI \-L\ ,\ \-\-extractlogo= <direction>[,width[,height]]
 extracts logo to /tmp as pgm files (must be renamed)
 <direction>  0 = top left,    1 = top right
                  2 = bottom left, 3 = bottom right
.TP 
.BI \-O\ ,\ \-\-OSD
 markad sends an OSD\-Message for start and end
.TP 
.BI \-R\ ,\ \-\-log2rec
 write logfiles into recording directory
.TP 
.BI \-T\ ,\ \-\-threads= <number>
 number of threads used for decoding, max. 16
 (default is the number of cpus)
.TP 
.BI \-V\ ,\ \-\-version
 print version\-info and exit
.TP 
.BI \-\-loglevel= <level>
 sets loglevel to the specified value
 <level> 1=error 2=info 3=debug 4=trace
.TP 
.BI \-\-markfile= <markfilename>
 set a different markfile\-name
.TP 
.BI \-\-nopid
 disables creation of \fImarkad.pid\fR file in recdir
.TP 
 \fB\-\-online[=1|2] ( default is 1 )
 start markad immediately when called with "before" as cmd
 if online is 1, markad starts online for live\-recordings
 only, online=2 starts markad online for every recording
 live\-recordings are identified by having a '@' in the
 filename so the entry 'Mark instant recording' in the menu
 \fISetup \- Recording\fR of the vdr should be set to 'yes'
.TP 
.BI \-\-svdrphost= \fR<ip/hostname>\fR " ( default is 127.0.0.1 ) "
 ip/hostname of a remote VDR for OSD messages
.TP
.BI \-\-ac3reencode
 re-encode AC3 stream to fix low audio level of cutted video on same devices
 requires --cut
 use it only if you really need it, it is very CPU consuming
.TP 
.BI \-\-cut
 cut video based on marks and store it in the recording directory
 there are no splits of the target file, make sure your filesystem can handle big files
.TP

.BI \-\-hwaccel= <hardware_acceleration_method >
 use hardware acceleration for decoding/encoding
 only vaapi is supported but you can try any of your FFmpeg and hardware supports
.TP

.BI \-\-vps
 use VPS events from markad.vps to optimize start and stop marks
.TP
.BI \-\-svdrpport= \fR<port>\fR  "  ( default is 6419 ) "
 port of a remote VDR for OSD messages

 cmd: one of
 \-                         dummy\-parameter if called directly
 nice                      runs markad directly and with nice(19)
 after                     markad started by vdr after the recording is complete
 before                    markad started by vdr before the recording is complete, only valid together with --online
 edited                    markad started by vdr in edit function and exits immediately
 <record>                  is the name of the directory where the recording is stored
