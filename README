Description:

MarkAd marks advertisements in VDR recordings.


Command line options:
   A few settings are given on the command line rather than in the setup menu.
   Available options:

     -b DIR,   --bindir=DIR          use DIR as location for markad executable
                                     (default: /usr/bin)
     -l DIR    --logocachedir=DIR    use DIR as location for markad logos
                                     (default: /var/lib/markad)

               --loglevel=<level>    sets log level of started markad process (standalone, not the plugin) to the specified value
                                     <level>: 1=error 2=info 3=debug 4=trace

               --astopoffs=SECONDS   assume stop of the recording SECONDS after the end of the EPG time.
                                     default is 0 s
                                     If end marks are to early, try to add some seconds

               --cut                 cut video based on marks and write it in the recording directory
                                     there are no splits of the target file, make sure your filesystem can handle big files

               --ac3reencode         re-encode AC3 stream to fix low audio level of cutted video on same devices
                                     requires --cut

               --autologo=<option>   0 = disable, only use logos from logo cache directory
                                     1 = deprecated, do not use
                                     2 = enable (default)
                                         if there is no suitable logo in the logo cache directroy markad will
                                         try to find the logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
                                         If this option is set you can not configure this feature from the VDR menue

VPS and markad plugin:
You can use VPS controlled timer. All marks will still determine by usual criteria.
Instead of VPS controlled timer or additional you can use VPS events to optimize your start, stop and break marks.
Prerequisites:
- Set "use VPS" to yes in the VDR plugin setup menu. If you use markad from command line, additional add parameter --vps to your markad call.
- pre timer must be smaller than post timer if you do not use VPS controlled timer

markad do not trust the VPS events. They will only be used if it found no usual criteria.
The VPS events are checked at the end of the recording and only used if they appear valid.
If markad is running during the recording, the VPS marks are applied after the end of the recording.
This is not a real VPS function and does not control your recording start/stop time. If you want to do this, use the VPS flag in the VDR timer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To report bugs please execute markad with at least the following command line parameters:
markad --loglevel=3 --log2rec nice <path to recording>
Post the files markad.log, marks, markad.vps, vps.log and info from the recording directory at https://www.vdr-portal.de.
